# SFDX Gulp Metadata Prototype

This is an early prototype of an idea to simplify metadata in SFDX projects. See [this post](https://ntotten.com/2018/02/09/simplify-sfdx-metadata-with-gulp/) for details.

The root of this project is the gulp module. You can see an example of how to use it in the `example` folder.
